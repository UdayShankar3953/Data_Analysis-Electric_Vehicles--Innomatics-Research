# Data Analysis on Electric Vehicles

Data is of high-value in todayâ€™s rapidly growing environment. I am always interested in learning about new technologies in this ever-changing field of computing.
Over the weekend, I participated in a Hackathon conducted by Innomatics Research Labs. 
Through this hackathon, I could leverage my learnings, which gave me an opportunity to explore the practical applications of Data Analysis field. 

The Project idea was to do 'Data Analysis on Electric vehicles'. The Analysis was done with the help of Python and I used various modules such as NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib. 

## Introduction of Electric Vehicles : 
The automobile industry is evolving and every major, minor and upcoming vehicle manufacturing company is shifting towards the adoption of Electric Vehicles termed as EVs.

Electric Vehicles are majorly categorized into 3 types:-

* Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV) : 
  - These vehicles are fully operated through power generated from a lithium-ion Battery.
  - BEVs do not contain traditional combustion engine and thus emits zero carbon monoxide or pollutants in the atmosphere.
  - Examples: Telsa Model 3, BMW i3, Ford Focus
    
* Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEV) :
  - This vehicle features both a conventional Combustion Engine and Battery powered Electric motor. But the battery cannot be charged by plugging in through an electric input or charging station, instead it captures energy while braking and the batteries are charged.
  - Mostly Electric motor is used at low speed and the combustion engine is used while going at higher speed, which gives maximum efficiency.
  - Examples: Volvo XC90, Toyota ps

* Plug-In Hybrid Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEV) :
      - This type of car operates on both a combustion engine and an electric-powered motor.
      - Unlike HEVs, PHEVs battery can be charged through a plug-in socked as well as power generated through brakes.
      - Examples: BMW i8, Toyota Pruis Prime
  
Other Categories of EVs are:

* Range Extension Type (REx) :
      - This type of vehicle features both a combustion engine and electric motor but most of the driving is done by the electric motor.
      - Example: BMW i3
  
* Fuel Cell Electric Vehicle (FCEV) :
      - FCEV stores hydrogen gas in the tank and uses electric motors like BEV
      - Example: Toyota FCV Concept.

  
In the Hackathon, we were given multiple tasks to do: 
## Task 1: To apply Exploratory Data Analysis (Univariate and Bivariate) using plotly.express library.

    *Insights :
    
        - Univariate Analysis :
           - The 5 topmost preferred EV company is Tesla followed by Nissan, Chevrolet, Ford and BMW.
           - In the dataset, Battery Electric Vehicles are found more by 76.4% followed by Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicles with 23.6%.
           - 52.1% of Electric vehicles are Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle(CAFV) eligible, 34.8% oF EVs eligibility is unknown since the battery range has not been researched and 13.1% of EVs are not CAFV eligible due to Low Battery Range.
           - Up until 2010, they were very few Electric Vehicles released and from 2016-2022 more Electric car models were released.
           
        - Bivariate Analysis :
            - CAFV Eligibile electric vehicles provide more Electric Range when compared to others.
            - From the analysis, we can stipulate that Battery Electric Vehicles provide more Electric Range than Plug-In Hybrid Electric vehicles.
            - BMW, AUDI and Volvo companies released more EV models. And companies like Flat, Chrysler, Subaru, Jaguar, Think etc etc made less number of EV models.
    
## Task 2: To create a Choropleth to display the number of EV vehicles based on location.

    *Insights :
    
        - From the Choropleth map, it is observed that Washington (WA) state has the highest number of Electric Vehicles usage.
    
## Task 3: To create a Racing Bar Plot to display the animation of EV Make and its count each year.

    *Insights :
    
        - The Racing Bar plot illustrates the EVs made by each company and its count per year.
        - Through the obtained animation frame, it can be depicted that Tesla has been consistent in releasing EVs since 2016 and it has the maximum count pf Evs since then.
        - Toyota, Nissan and Chevrolet are also competing fairly in the race of manufacturing EVs.
        
    
I was fascinated by the fact that we can transform data into critical fragments of information and get insights to make informed meaningful decisions. 
It has been an enriching experience that has helped me sharpen my knowledge.
